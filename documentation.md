# Phoneme Characteristics Analysis: An Interactive Exploration for Text-to-Speech Understanding

## 1. Introduction to Phonetics and TTS Application Overview
Duration: 0:05

This codelab will guide you through an interactive Streamlit application designed to explore the fundamental characteristics of phonemes and their crucial role in Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. We will generate, visualize, and model synthetic phonetic data to understand how features like duration, pitch, and energy contribute to speech naturalness.

At the core of human speech are **phonemes**, the smallest units of sound that differentiate meaning. These fundamental units possess measurable acoustic characteristics:
*   **Duration ($\text{ms}$)**: How long a phoneme is held.
*   **Pitch ($\text{Hz}$)**: The fundamental frequency of the sound, perceived as how high or low a voice is.
*   **Energy**: The intensity or volume of the sound.

These characteristics are vital for **prosody** (the rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech), which in turn, ensures that synthesized speech sounds natural, expressive, and intelligible.

### Business Value:
Understanding these phoneme characteristics is essential for:
*   Developing **advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems** that generate human-like speech.
*   Creating effective **language learning tools**, such as interactive phoneme trainers, that help learners master pronunciation.
*   Identifying **patterns and distinctions** between speech sounds for improved speech recognition and synthesis.

### What We Will Be Covering / Learning:
*   **Fundamental concepts** in phonetics and TTS architectures.
*   The influence of **phoneme-level features** (duration, pitch, energy) on speech properties.
*   Methods to **generate, validate, and explore synthetic datasets** resembling phonetic data.
*   **Data visualization techniques** to uncover trends and relationships.
*   **Simplified analytical models** (clustering, regression) to categorize phonemes and predict synthetic speech quality.
*   The implementation of **interactive elements** to facilitate data exploration and learning.

### Application Architecture:
The application is structured into three main pages, accessible via a sidebar, each focusing on different aspects of phoneme analysis:

```
This architecture ensures a logical flow, starting with data generation and validation, moving to exploratory data analysis, and finally to advanced modeling and interactive tools.

## 2. Setting Up the Development Environment
Duration: 0:05

To run this Streamlit application, you will need Python installed on your system, along with several libraries.

### Prerequisites:
*   **Python 3.7+**
*   **pip** (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps:
1.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly
    ```
    Note: The provided application pages use a mix of `matplotlib`/`seaborn` and `plotly.express`. Ensure both are installed to avoid potential issues. The latest `page2.py` and `page3.py` provided use `plotly.express`, so this is the primary visualization library.

4.  **Save the application code:**
    Create the following file structure and save the provided Python code into the respective files:
    ```
    .
    ├── app.py
    └── application_pages/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── page1.py
        ├── page2.py
        └── page3.py
    ```
    The `__init__.py` file can be empty.

### Running the Application:
Once all dependencies are installed and the files are in place, you can run the Streamlit application from your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This command will open the application in your default web browser.

## 3. Generating Synthetic Phoneme Data
Duration: 0:10

Due to the complexities of acquiring and processing real-world phonetic data, we begin by generating a **synthetic dataset**. This allows us to simulate realistic phoneme characteristics in a controlled environment for analysis and learning.

### Application Functionality:
Navigate to the "Data Generation & Validation" page using the sidebar. This page contains a section titled "Phoneme Characteristics Analysis: An Interactive Exploration for Text-to-Speech Understanding" which provides the context and explanation. Below this, you'll find the "1. Synthetic Dataset Generation: Phoneme Characteristics" section.

The `generate_synthetic_phoneme_data` function creates a Pandas DataFrame with various features:
*   `phoneme_id`: Unique identifier.
*   `phoneme_symbol`: The linguistic symbol (e.g., 'a', 'b').
*   `word_context`: Simulated word environment.
*   `duration_ms`: Phoneme duration in milliseconds.
*   `avg_pitch_hz`: Average pitch in Hertz.
*   `max_energy`: Maximum energy (arbitrary units).
*   `is_vowel`: Boolean indicating if it's a vowel.
*   `dialect`: Simulated dialect.
*   `pronunciation_naturalness_score`: A synthetic score (0-100) representing naturalness.

These features are designed to have realistic variations and correlations (e.g., vowels tend to have longer durations and higher energy than consonants).

### Interactive Data Generation:
You can control the synthetic data generation using the widgets in the **sidebar**:
*   **Number of Samples**: Adjust the total number of phoneme instances.
*   **Phoneme Symbols**: Select which phonemes to include.
*   **Word Contexts**: Choose simulated word contexts.
*   **Dialects**: Specify dialects for subtle variations.
*   **Random Seed**: Ensure reproducibility of the generated data.

<aside class="positive">
It's a good practice to use a **fixed `random_seed`** for reproducibility, especially when sharing or re-running experiments.
</aside>

**To Generate Data:**
1.  Open the Streamlit application in your browser.
2.  Ensure you are on the "Data Generation & Validation" page.
3.  Adjust the parameters in the sidebar as desired.
4.  Click the **"Generate Synthetic Data"** button.

The application will display the first 5 rows of the generated DataFrame and provide a summary of the dataset.

```python
# From application_pages/page1.py
@st.cache_data # Cache the generated data to prevent re-running on every interaction
def generate_synthetic_phoneme_data(num_samples, phoneme_symbols, word_contexts, dialects, random_seed):
    """
    Generates a Pandas DataFrame with synthetic phoneme data, including features
    like duration, pitch, energy, and a naturalness score, with variations
    based on phoneme type (vowel/consonant) and specific phoneme symbols.
    """
    # ... (function implementation as provided)
    # The function ensures proper validation and generates data based on defined parameters.
    # For instance, vowels are generally assigned longer durations and higher energy.
    # A 'pronunciation_naturalness_score' is synthetically derived based on these features.
    # ...
    df = pd.DataFrame(data_records)
    return df[expected_column_names]

# Sidebar widgets for input (simplified for brevity)
# with st.sidebar:
#     num_samples = st.number_input("Number of Samples", ...)
#     phoneme_symbols_input = st.multiselect("Phoneme Symbols", ...)
#     word_contexts_input = st.multiselect("Word Contexts", ...)
#     dialects_input = st.multiselect("Dialects", ...)
#     random_seed = st.number_input("Random Seed", ...)
#     if st.button("Generate Synthetic Data", key="generate_data_button"):
#         st.session_state['phoneme_df'] = generate_synthetic_phoneme_data(...)
#         # ... save parameters to session_state
#         st.success("Synthetic phoneme data generated!")

# Display the generated DataFrame head
# if 'phoneme_df' in st.session_state:
#     st.subheader("First 5 rows of the synthetic phoneme data:")
#     st.dataframe(st.session_state['phoneme_df'].head())
#     st.markdown(f"The output above confirms...")
# else:
#     st.info("Adjust parameters in the sidebar and click 'Generate Synthetic Data' to begin.")
```

**Expected Output:**
After clicking "Generate Synthetic Data", you will see a table similar to this:
```
First 5 rows of the synthetic phoneme data:
   phoneme_id phoneme_symbol word_context  duration_ms  avg_pitch_hz  max_energy  is_vowel          dialect  pronunciation_naturalness_score

```

This table provides a glimpse into the structure and content of our synthetic phoneme dataset, which will be the basis for all subsequent analysis.

## 4. Exploring and Validating the Dataset
Duration: 0:10

Before diving into deep analysis, it's crucial to explore the basic structure and validate the integrity of our dataset. This ensures that the generated synthetic data is consistent with our expectations and suitable for modeling. This step is located on the "Data Generation & Validation" page.

### DataFrame Information and Summary Statistics:
The application first displays `df.info()` output, which shows the data types and non-null counts for each column, followed by `df.describe()`, which provides summary statistics for numeric columns.

```python
# From application_pages/page1.py
# if 'phoneme_df' in st.session_state:
#     st.subheader("DataFrame Information:")
#     buffer = io.StringIO()
#     st.session_state['phoneme_df'].info(buf=buffer)
#     s = buffer.getvalue()
#     st.text(s) # Displaying info as plain text

#     st.subheader("Summary Statistics for Numeric Columns:")
#     st.dataframe(st.session_state['phoneme_df'].describe())
# else:
#     st.info("Generate synthetic data first to explore it.")
```

**Expected Output (`df.info()`):**
```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 1000 entries, 0 to 999
Data columns (total 9 columns):
 #   Column                           Non-Null Count  Dtype  
                             --  --  
 0   phoneme_id                       1000 non-null   int64

 5   max_energy                       1000 non-null   float64
 6   is_vowel                         1000 non-null   bool   
 7   dialect                          1000 non-null   object 
 8   pronunciation_naturalness_score  1000 non-null   float64
dtypes: bool(1), float64(4), int64(1), object(3)
memory usage: 63.6+ KB
```
This output confirms that all columns have the expected number of non-null entries (matching `num_samples`) and the correct data types.

**Expected Output (`df.describe()`):**
```

```
These statistics give us a quantitative overview of the data's central tendency and spread, confirming realistic ranges for phonetic features.

### Data Validation:
The application includes a `validate_and_summarize_data` function that performs a series of checks:
1.  **Expected Column Names**: Ensures all necessary columns are present.
2.  **Expected Data Types**: Verifies that columns have the correct data types.
3.  **Missing Values in Critical Fields**: Checks for `NaN` values in `duration_ms`, `avg_pitch_hz`, and `max_energy`.

```python
# From application_pages/page1.py
def validate_and_summarize_data(df, expected_columns, expected_dtypes, critical_fields):
    """
    Performs data validation and logs summary statistics.
    Checks for:
    1. Presence of all expected columns.
    2. Correct data types for specified columns.
    3. Absence of missing values in critical fields.
    """
    # ... (implementation as provided)
    # The function prints success/error messages for each validation step
    # and also prints numeric summary statistics.
    # ...
    return validation_passed

# if 'phoneme_df' in st.session_state:
#     expected_columns = [
#         'phoneme_id', 'phoneme_symbol', 'word_context', 'duration_ms',
#         'avg_pitch_hz', 'max_energy', 'is_vowel', 'dialect', 'pronunciation_naturalness_score'
#     ]
#     expected_dtypes = {
#         'phoneme_id': 'int64', 'phoneme_symbol': 'object', 'word_context': 'object',
#         'duration_ms': 'float64', 'avg_pitch_hz': 'float64', 'max_energy': 'float64',
#         'is_vowel': 'bool', 'dialect': 'object', 'pronunciation_naturalness_score': 'float64'
#     }
#     critical_fields = ['duration_ms', 'avg_pitch_hz', 'max_energy']
    
#     st.session_state['data_validated'] = validate_and_summarize_data(
#         st.session_state['phoneme_df'], expected_columns, expected_dtypes, critical_fields
#     )
#     st.markdown("The validation results confirm that our synthetic `phoneme_df` meets...")
# else:
#     st.info("Generate synthetic data first to validate it.")
```

**Expected Validation Results:**
If the data generation was successful, you should see messages similar to:
```
 Starting Data Validation 
Validation Step 1: All 9 expected columns are present.
Validation Step 2: All column data types match expected types.
Validation Step 3: No missing values in critical fields.
 Data Validation Complete: All checks passed 
 Data Summary 
Summary statistics for numeric columns:
... (df.describe() output)
 Summary Complete 
```
This confirms that the dataset is ready for further analysis.

## 5. Visualizing Phoneme Distributions
Duration: 0:15

Initial visualization of feature distributions is a critical step in phonetic analysis. It allows us to understand the spread, central tendency, and shape of our data, revealing patterns that might not be obvious from summary statistics alone. This step is located on the "Visualizing Relationships & Comparisons" page.

### Application Functionality:
Navigate to the "Visualizing Relationships & Comparisons" page. This page will display histograms for `duration_ms`, `avg_pitch_hz`, and `max_energy`.

The `plot_distribution_histogram` function utilizes `plotly.express` to generate interactive histograms with KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) for a smoother representation of the distribution.

```python
# From application_pages/page2.py
def plot_distribution_histogram(df, column_name, title, x_label, y_label, bins=30):
    fig = px.histogram(df, x=column_name, nbins=bins, title=title, 
                       labels={column_name: x_label, "count": y_label}, 
                       color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Plotly)
    fig.update_layout(bargap=0.1)
    return fig

# if st.session_state.get('data_validated', False):
#     st.subheader("Distribution Histograms")
#     bins_input = st.slider("Number of Bins for Histograms", min_value=10, max_value=50, value=30, step=5,
#                            help="Adjust the number of bins to see different levels of detail in the distributions.")

#     col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
#     with col1:
#         fig1 = plot_distribution_histogram(st.session_state['phoneme_df'], 'duration_ms', ...)
#         st.plotly_chart(fig1)
#     with col2:
#         fig2 = plot_distribution_histogram(st.session_state['phoneme_df'], 'avg_pitch_hz', ...)
#         st.plotly_chart(fig2)
#     with col3:
#         fig3 = plot_distribution_histogram(st.session_state['phoneme_df'], 'max_energy', ...)
#         st.plotly_chart(fig3)
# else:
#     st.info("Perform data generation and validation first to visualize distributions.")
```

**Interacting with the Visualizations:**
*   Use the **"Number of Bins for Histograms"** slider to adjust the granularity of the distributions. Fewer bins show a coarser overview, while more bins reveal finer details.
*   Hover over the bars in the Plotly charts for exact counts and values.

**Interpretation:**
*   **Duration ($\text{ms}$)**: You will likely observe a bimodal or multimodal distribution, reflecting the synthetic distinction between generally shorter consonants and longer vowels.
*   **Average Pitch ($\text{Hz}$)**: This distribution might also show distinct peaks, influenced by the different pitch ranges assigned to vowels and consonants, or specific phonemes.
*   **Maximum Energy**: The energy distribution typically differentiates between lower-energy consonants and higher-energy vowels.

These varied shapes confirm that our synthetic data successfully captures realistic variability and categorical distinctions, crucial for simulating phonetic phenomena for a phoneme trainer or TTS system.

## 6. Analyzing Relationships Between Features
Duration: 0:20

Understanding how different phonetic features interact with each other is vital for comprehending speech formation and perception. Correlations between features like pitch, energy, and duration help us build more accurate predictive models and identify complex patterns in phoneme pronunciation. This step is also on the "Visualizing Relationships & Comparisons" page.

### Application Functionality:
The application provides two types of plots for analyzing relationships:
1.  **Scatter Plots**: To visualize pairwise relationships, optionally colored by categorical variables (`is_vowel`, `dialect`).
2.  **Pair Plot (`plotly.express.scatter_matrix`)**: A comprehensive grid showing all pairwise relationships and individual distributions for selected numeric features.

The `plot_scatter_relationship` and `plot_features_pairplot` functions use `plotly.express` for interactive and visually rich plots.

```python
# From application_pages/page2.py
def plot_scatter_relationship(df, x_column, y_column, hue_column, title, x_label, y_label):
    fig = px.scatter(df, x=x_column, y=y_column, color=hue_column, title=title, 
                     labels={x_column: x_label, y_column: y_label}, 
                     color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Plotly)
    fig.update_layout(xaxis_title=x_label, yaxis_title=y_label)
    return fig

def plot_features_pairplot(df, features_list, hue_column=None, title=None):
    if df.empty or not features_list:
        st.warning("Cannot plot an empty DataFrame or with no specified features.")
        return None
    
    fig = px.scatter_matrix(df, dimensions=features_list, color=hue_column, title=title,
                            color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Plotly)
    fig.update_layout(title_y=0.99, title_x=0.5, font_size=12)
    return fig

# if st.session_state.get('data_validated', False):
#     st.subheader("Relationship Plots")

#     st.write("#### Duration vs. Pitch, by Vowel/Consonant")
#     fig_s1 = plot_scatter_relationship(st.session_state['phoneme_df'], 'duration_ms', 'avg_pitch_hz', 'is_vowel', ...)
#     st.plotly_chart(fig_s1)

#     st.write("#### Max Energy vs. Pitch, by Dialect")
#     fig_s2 = plot_scatter_relationship(st.session_state['phoneme_df'], 'max_energy', 'avg_pitch_hz', 'dialect', ...)
#     st.plotly_chart(fig_s2)

#     st.subheader("Pair Plot of Phoneme Characteristics")
#     numeric_cols_for_pairplot = ['duration_ms', 'avg_pitch_hz', 'max_energy', 'pronunciation_naturalness_score']
#     selected_pairplot_features = st.multiselect("Select Features for Pair Plot", options=numeric_cols_for_pairplot, ...)
#     pairplot_hue_options = ['None'] + [col for col in st.session_state['phoneme_df'].select_dtypes(include='object').columns if col != 'phoneme_symbol'] + ['is_vowel']
#     selected_pairplot_hue = st.selectbox("Color Pair Plot by (Hue)", options=pairplot_hue_options, ...)
#     pairplot_hue_val = None if selected_pairplot_hue == 'None' else selected_pairplot_hue

#     if st.button("Generate Pair Plot", key="pairplot_button"):
#         # ... save selection to session_state
#         fig_pair = plot_features_pairplot(st.session_state['phoneme_df'], selected_pairplot_features, hue_column=pairplot_hue_val, ...)
#         if fig_pair:
#             st.plotly_chart(fig_pair)
# else:
#     st.info("Perform data generation and validation first to analyze relationships.")
```

**Interacting with the Visualizations:**
*   For the scatter plots, observe the separation or overlap of points based on the `hue_column` (e.g., `is_vowel` or `dialect`).
*   For the Pair Plot:
    *   Use the **"Select Features for Pair Plot"** multiselect to choose which numeric columns to include.
    *   Use the **"Color Pair Plot by (Hue)"** selectbox to color-code points by a categorical variable.
    *   Click **"Generate Pair Plot"** to update the visualization.
    *   Hover over points for details, and use the zoom/pan tools for closer inspection.

**Interpretation:**
*   **Duration vs. Pitch (by Vowel/Consonant)**: You'll typically see clear clusters. Vowels (True for `is_vowel`) often have longer durations and higher average pitches, while consonants (False for `is_vowel`) have shorter durations and lower pitches.
*   **Max Energy vs. Pitch (by Dialect)**: This plot might show how different simulated dialects are distributed across energy and pitch ranges, possibly revealing subtle regional variations.
*   **Pair Plot**:
    *   **Histograms on the diagonal** reaffirm the individual distributions.
    *   **Scatter plots off-diagonal** reveal pairwise correlations. For example, a positive correlation between `duration_ms` and `max_energy` (longer phonemes tend to be more energetic) is common. The `pronunciation_naturalness_score` will likely show positive correlations with these acoustic features, as our synthetic data was designed this way.

These interactive visualizations provide critical insights into how phonetic features interact and how categorical factors influence these interactions, forming a strong foundation for TTS systems or phoneme training tools.

## 7. Categorical Comparisons of Phoneme Characteristics
Duration: 0:15

Comparing phoneme characteristics across different categories is essential for identifying distinct acoustic patterns and variations. This analysis helps us understand how individual phonemes behave, how vowels differ from consonants, and how regional accents might manifest acoustically. This step is also on the "Visualizing Relationships & Comparisons" page.

### Application Functionality:
The application generates bar charts to compare average values of key phonetic features across different categorical columns:
*   **Average Phoneme Duration by Symbol**: Shows `duration_ms` for each `phoneme_symbol`.
*   **Average Pitch by Dialect**: Shows `avg_pitch_hz` for each `dialect`.
*   **Average Naturalness Score: Vowels vs. Consonants**: Compares `pronunciation_naturalness_score` based on `is_vowel`.

The `plot_categorical_bar_comparison` function uses `plotly.express` to create these comparative bar charts.

```python
# From application_pages/page2.py
def plot_categorical_bar_comparison(df, category_column, value_column, title, x_label, y_label):
    grouped_data = df.groupby(category_column)[value_column].mean().reset_index()
    fig = px.bar(grouped_data, x=category_column, y=value_column, title=title, 
                 labels={category_column: x_label, value_column: y_label},
                 color=category_column, color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Vivid)
    fig.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=-45) # Rotate x-axis labels if many categories
    return fig

# if st.session_state.get('data_validated', False):
#     st.subheader("Bar Charts for Categorical Comparisons")
    
#     st.write("#### Average Phoneme Duration by Symbol")
#     fig_b1 = plot_categorical_bar_comparison(st.session_state['phoneme_df'], 'phoneme_symbol', 'duration_ms', ...)
#     st.plotly_chart(fig_b1)

#     st.write("#### Average Pitch by Dialect")
#     fig_b2 = plot_categorical_bar_comparison(st.session_state['phoneme_df'], 'dialect', 'avg_pitch_hz', ...)
#     st.plotly_chart(fig_b2)

#     st.write("#### Average Naturalness Score: Vowels vs. Consonants")
#     fig_b3 = plot_categorical_bar_comparison(st.session_state['phoneme_df'], 'is_vowel', 'pronunciation_naturalness_score', ...)
#     st.plotly_chart(fig_b3)
# else:
#     st.info("Perform data generation and validation first to visualize categorical comparisons.")
```

**Interpretation:**
*   **Average Phoneme Duration by Symbol**: You will observe clear differences in average durations, with vowels typically showing longer durations than consonants, reflecting their nature as sustained sounds.
*   **Average Pitch by Dialect**: This plot can reveal subtle differences in average pitch across the simulated dialects, illustrating how regional variations can impact fundamental speech characteristics.
*   **Average Naturalness Score: Vowels vs. Consonants**: Based on our synthetic data generation, you might see that vowels tend to have a higher average naturalness score, indicating their acoustic prominence and role in prosody.

These categorical comparisons are crucial for understanding how specific phoneme types and dialects contribute to the overall acoustic properties of speech. These insights are directly applicable to a phoneme trainer, where learners could focus on specific categories or dialectal pronunciations based on their distinct characteristics.

## 8. Understanding and Simulating Latent Features
Duration: 0:10

In advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, raw linguistic features are often transformed into a more abstract, lower-dimensional representation known as "**latent features**" or "embeddings." This process is typically performed by an `Encoder` component within the TTS architecture. Latent features are not directly interpretable like raw features (e.g., "duration in ms") but are incredibly powerful for machine learning models because they capture complex, underlying relationships efficiently.

This abstraction aids in:
*   **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of variables, simplifying model training.
*   **Feature Compression**: Storing salient information in a compact form.
*   **Complex Relationship Modeling**: Allowing the model to learn and represent intricate, non-linear relationships.

This step is located on the "Advanced Analysis & Interactive Tools" page.

### Application Functionality:
Navigate to the "Advanced Analysis & Interactive Tools" page. The "8. Simulating Phoneme Feature Embeddings" section demonstrates a simplified creation of these latent features by **standardizing** the numeric features (`duration_ms`, `avg_pitch_hz`, `max_energy`).

**Standardization** scales features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, preventing features with larger scales from dominating algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes. The formula used is:
$$ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} $$
where $x$ is the original feature value, $\mu$ is the mean, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

The `create_simple_latent_features` function uses `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` for this task.

```python
# From application_pages/page3.py
def create_simple_latent_features(df, numeric_features_list):
    """
    Standardizes specified numeric features from the DataFrame using StandardScaler
    to create 'latent features'.
    """
    features_to_scale = df[numeric_features_list]
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    scaled_features_array = scaler.fit_transform(features_to_scale)
    scaled_df = pd.DataFrame(scaled_features_array, 
                             columns=numeric_features_list, 
                             index=df.index)
    return scaled_df

# if st.session_state.get('data_validated', False):
#     st.subheader("Generated Latent Features")
#     numeric_features = ['duration_ms', 'avg_pitch_hz', 'max_energy']
#     st.session_state['latent_features_df'] = create_simple_latent_features(st.session_state['phoneme_df'], numeric_features)
    
#     st.write("First 5 rows of the simulated latent features:")
#     st.dataframe(st.session_state['latent_features_df'].head())
# else:
#     st.info("Perform data generation and validation first to create latent features.")
```

**Expected Output:**
After validation, the application will automatically display the first 5 rows of the `latent_features_df`:
```
First 5 rows of the simulated latent features:
   duration_ms  avg_pitch_hz  max_energy
0    -0.999719     -1.057393   -0.880756
1     1.280424      1.421715    1.822986
2    -0.704250     -0.564998   -0.343048
3     0.927237      0.530777    0.968772
4     0.738872      0.812235    0.999661
```
This output shows that the original raw features have been transformed into a standardized scale, with values centered around zero. This `latent_features_df` serves as a conceptual "embedding" for each phoneme, ready for machine learning tasks like clustering.

## 9. Clustering Phonemes by Acoustic Similarity
Duration: 0:15

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group data points that share similar characteristics. In phonetics, clustering phonemes by their acoustic properties can help identify naturally similar-sounding groups, which is beneficial for tasks like a language trainer (identifying easily confusable sounds) or understanding inherent phonetic distinctions. This step is located on the "Advanced Analysis & Interactive Tools" page.

### Application Functionality:
The application uses the **K-Means algorithm** for clustering. K-Means partitions $n$ observations into $k$ clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). The algorithm aims to minimize the **within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)**, defined as:

$$ WCSS = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in S_i} \|x - \mu_i\|^2 $$

where:
*   $k$ is the number of clusters.
*   $S_i$ is the $i$-th cluster.
*   $x$ is a data point in cluster $S_i$.
*   $\mu_i$ is the centroid (mean) of cluster $S_i$.

The clustering is performed on the `latent_features_df` (standardized `duration_ms`, `avg_pitch_hz`, `max_energy`) to ensure all features contribute equally to the distance calculations.

The `perform_kmeans_clustering` function applies the K-Means algorithm using `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`.

```python
# From application_pages/page3.py
def perform_kmeans_clustering(data, n_clusters, random_state):
    """
    Applies K-Means clustering to identify groups in data.
    """
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=random_state, n_init='auto')
    kmeans.fit(data)
    return kmeans.labels_

# if 'latent_features_df' in st.session_state and st.session_state.get('data_validated', False):
#     st.subheader("K-Means Clustering")
#     num_clusters = st.slider("Number of Clusters ($k$)", min_value=2, max_value=10, value=st.session_state.get('num_clusters', 4), step=1, ...)
#     if st.button("Perform Clustering", key="perform_clustering_button"):
#         # ... save num_clusters to session_state
#         cluster_labels = perform_kmeans_clustering(st.session_state['latent_features_df'], num_clusters, st.session_state['random_seed'])
#         st.session_state['phoneme_df']['cluster_label'] = cluster_labels # Add to original df
#         st.success("Clustering complete!")
    
#     if 'cluster_label' in st.session_state['phoneme_df'].columns:
#         st.write("Cluster counts:")
#         st.dataframe(st.session_state['phoneme_df']['cluster_label'].value_counts())

#         st.write("#### Phoneme Clusters: Duration vs. Pitch")
#         fig_cluster = px.scatter(
#             st.session_state['phoneme_df'], x='duration_ms', y='avg_pitch_hz',
#             color='cluster_label', title='Phoneme Clusters: Duration vs. Pitch', ...
#         )
#         fig_cluster.update_traces(marker=dict(size=10, opacity=0.8))
#         st.plotly_chart(fig_cluster)
# else:
#     st.info("Perform data generation, validation, and latent feature creation first to perform clustering.")
```

**Interacting with Clustering:**
1.  Use the **"Number of Clusters ($k$)"** slider to choose the desired number of clusters (e.g., 4).
2.  Click the **"Perform Clustering"** button.

The application will display the count of phonemes in each cluster and a scatter plot of 'Duration vs. Pitch' colored by the assigned `cluster_label`.

**Interpretation:**
*   **Cluster Counts**: This table shows how many phonemes fall into each cluster, indicating the balance of the groupings.
*   **Visual Interpretation**: The scatter plot visually demonstrates the separation of phonemes into distinct groups. For instance, one cluster might represent phonemes with shorter durations and lower pitches (likely consonants), while another might group phonemes with longer durations and higher pitches (likely vowels). Intermediate clusters can represent sounds with mixed characteristics.

This conceptual clustering aids in categorizing phonemes for educational purposes. Acoustically similar phonemes within the same cluster could be identified as "difficult to distinguish" groups for language learners, allowing trainers to focus on specific pronunciation challenges.

## 10. Predictive Modeling for Phoneme Naturalness
Duration: 0:15

In real-world TTS and language learning, the "naturalness" or "quality" of speech pronunciation is a critical metric. Our synthetic `pronunciation_naturalness_score` serves as a proxy for this concept, quantifying how "natural" a phoneme's pronunciation is based on its acoustic characteristics. This score becomes our **target variable** for a predictive modeling task. By building a model to predict this score, we conceptually understand how acoustic features contribute to perceived naturalness. This step is located on the "Advanced Analysis & Interactive Tools" page.

### Data Preparation:
Before modeling, the data is prepared by:
1.  Selecting the **features ($X$)**: `duration_ms`, `avg_pitch_hz`, `max_energy`.
2.  Selecting the **target variable ($y$)**: `pronunciation_naturalness_score`.
3.  Splitting the data into **training and testing sets** using `train_test_split` (80% for training, 20% for testing) to ensure robust model evaluation on unseen data.

```python
# From application_pages/page3.py
# if 'phoneme_df' in st.session_state and st.session_state.get('data_validated', False):
#     st.subheader("Data Preparation for Modeling")
#     X = st.session_state['phoneme_df'][['duration_ms', 'avg_pitch_hz', 'max_energy']]
#     y = st.session_state['phoneme_df']['pronunciation_naturalness_score']

#     X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=st.session_state['random_seed'])

#     st.session_state['X_train'] = X_train
#     st.session_state['X_test'] = X_test
#     st.session_state['y_train'] = y_train
#     st.session_state['y_test'] = y_test

#     st.write(f"Training set size: {len(X_train)} samples")
#     st.write(f"Testing set size: {len(X_test)} samples")
#     st.success("Features (X) and target (y) prepared and split into training/testing sets.")
# else:
#     st.info("Perform data generation and validation first to prepare data for modeling.")
```
The application will display the sizes of the training and testing sets.

### Linear Regression Model:
We use **Linear Regression**, a simple and interpretable model that fits a linear equation to the observed data. The multiple linear regression equation is:

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon $$

Where:
*   $y$ is the `pronunciation_naturalness_score`.
*   $x_i$ are the independent variables (`duration_ms`, `avg_pitch_hz`, `max_energy`).
*   $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept.
*   $\beta_i$ are the coefficients, indicating the change in $y$ for a one-unit change in $x_i$.
*   $\epsilon$ is the error term.

The `train_simple_regression_model` function trains the model, and `evaluate_regression_model` calculates performance metrics:
*   **R-squared (R2)**: Proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables. Higher is better (up to 1).
*   **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between predictions and actual values. Lower is better.

```python
# From application_pages/page3.py
def train_simple_regression_model(X_train, y_train):
    """
    Trains a sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression model.
    """
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model

def evaluate_regression_model(model, X_test, y_test):
    """
    Evaluates the performance of a trained regression model.
    """
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
    return r2, mae

# if all(key in st.session_state for key in ['X_train', 'y_train', 'X_test', 'y_test']):
#     st.subheader("Linear Regression Model")
#     if st.button("Train and Evaluate Regression Model", key="train_eval_model_button"):
#         regression_model = train_simple_regression_model(st.session_state['X_train'], st.session_state['y_train'])
#         st.session_state['regression_model'] = regression_model
#         st.success("Regression Model Training Complete.")

#         st.write("### Model Coefficients:")
#         for feature, coef in zip(st.session_state['X_train'].columns, regression_model.coef_):
#             st.write(f"- {feature}: {coef:.4f}")
#         st.write(f"- Intercept: {regression_model.intercept_:.4f}")

#         st.write("### Evaluating Model Performance on Test Set:")
#         r2, mae = evaluate_regression_model(regression_model, st.session_state['X_test'], st.session_state['y_test'])
#         st.write(f"R-squared Score: {r2:.4f}")
#         st.write(f"Mean Absolute Error (MAE): {mae:.4f}")
# else:
#     st.info("Prepare data for modeling first to train and evaluate the regression model.")
```

**Interacting with the Model:**
Click the **"Train and Evaluate Regression Model"** button to train the model and see its performance.

**Interpretation:**
*   **Model Coefficients**: These indicate the synthetic influence of each feature on the `pronunciation_naturalness_score`. Positive coefficients suggest a positive correlation (e.g., higher energy contributing to higher naturalness, within the simulated ideal range).
*   **R-squared Score**: A high R-squared (e.g., > 0.8) indicates that our features explain a large proportion of the variance in the naturalness score, meaning the model fits the synthetic data well.
*   **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: A low MAE suggests that the model's predictions are, on average, close to the actual naturalness scores.

These results confirm that, within our synthetic framework, phoneme characteristics are strong predictors of pronunciation naturalness, conceptually demonstrating how a TTS system or phoneme trainer could assess speech quality.

## 11. Interactive Phoneme Analysis for Language Learning
Duration: 0:10

Interactive tools are invaluable for language learners and phoneticians. They provide a dynamic way to explore and compare phonemes, reinforcing auditory discrimination and phonetic awareness. By allowing direct interaction with the data, users can gain a deeper, more intuitive understanding of how different acoustic characteristics contribute to the uniqueness of each sound. This final functional step is located on the "Advanced Analysis & Interactive Tools" page.

### Application Functionality:
The **"Interactive Phoneme Analyzer"** allows you to:
1.  **Select a Phoneme**: Choose any `phoneme_symbol` from a dropdown menu.
2.  **Display Characteristics**: Upon selection, the application dynamically shows the average `duration_ms`, `avg_pitch_hz`, `max_energy`, and `pronunciation_naturalness_score` for that specific phoneme.
3.  **Compare Averages**: A bar chart is generated, visually comparing the selected phoneme's average acoustic features against the overall dataset averages. This provides immediate context and highlights distinctive features.

The interactive comparison utilizes `plotly.express` for a dynamic bar chart.

```python
# From application_pages/page3.py
# if 'phoneme_df' in st.session_state and st.session_state.get('data_validated', False):
#     st.subheader("Interactive Phoneme Analyzer")
#     unique_phoneme_symbols = sorted(st.session_state['phoneme_df']['phoneme_symbol'].unique().tolist())
    
#     selected_phoneme = st.selectbox("Select a Phoneme:", options=unique_phoneme_symbols, ...)

#     if selected_phoneme:
#         CHAR_COLS = ['duration_ms', 'avg_pitch_hz', 'max_energy', 'pronunciation_naturalness_score']
        
#         overall_averages = st.session_state['phoneme_df'][CHAR_COLS].mean()
#         phoneme_averages = st.session_state['phoneme_df'].groupby('phoneme_symbol')[CHAR_COLS].mean()
        
#         selected_phoneme_data = phoneme_averages.loc[selected_phoneme]

#         st.markdown(f"### Characteristics for Phoneme: '{selected_phoneme}'")
#         for char_col in CHAR_COLS:
#             val = selected_phoneme_data.get(char_col)
#             if pd.isna(val):
#                 st.write(f"**{char_col.replace('_', ' ').title()}:** N/A")
#             else:
#                 st.write(f"**{char_col.replace('_', ' ').title()}:** {val:.2f}")

#         # Generate Bar Chart for comparison using Plotly
#         labels = [col.replace('_', ' ').title() for col in CHAR_COLS[:-1]]
#         phoneme_values_plot = [selected_phoneme_data.get(col, 0) for col in CHAR_COLS[:-1]]
#         overall_values_plot = [overall_averages.get(col, 0) for col in CHAR_COLS[:-1]]

#         comparison_data = pd.DataFrame({
#             'Characteristic': labels * 2,
#             'Average Value': phoneme_values_plot + overall_values_plot,
#             'Category': [f'Phoneme "{selected_phoneme}"'] * len(labels) + ['Overall Dataset'] * len(labels)
#         })
        
#         fig_compare = px.bar(comparison_data, x='Characteristic', y='Average Value', color='Category', 
#                              barmode='group', title=f'Comparison of Acoustic Characteristics for Phoneme "{selected_phoneme}" vs. Overall Dataset', ...)
#         fig_compare.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=-45)
#         st.plotly_chart(fig_compare)
# else:
#     st.info("Perform data generation and validation first to use the interactive analyzer.")
```

**Interacting with the Analyzer:**
1.  Use the **"Select a Phoneme:"** dropdown menu to choose a phoneme (e.g., 'a', 's', 'k').
2.  Observe the average characteristics displayed in text.
3.  Analyze the bar chart to see how the selected phoneme's averages compare to the overall dataset averages.

This interactive tool provides a practical way for learners to explore acoustic differences, making it easier to understand why certain sounds might be harder to distinguish or pronounce correctly. For example, you can quickly see if a phoneme has a significantly longer duration or higher pitch compared to the average, indicating its unique acoustic signature.

## 12. Conclusion and Key Insights
Duration: 0:05

Throughout this interactive application, we've explored the fundamental characteristics of phonemes within a synthetic dataset, drawing inspiration from the principles of phonetics and Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. We've gained several key insights:

*   **Phoneme Characteristic Distributions**: Our initial visualizations (histograms) revealed the varied distributions of features like `duration_ms`, `avg_pitch_hz`, and `max_energy`, often showing distinct patterns for vowels and consonants. This underscores the diverse acoustic nature of different speech sounds.

*   **Relationships Between Features**: Scatter plots and pair plots elucidated the interrelationships between these acoustic features. We observed that longer durations often correlate with higher energy, and that categorical factors like `is_vowel` and `dialect` significantly influence pitch, duration, and energy profiles. These correlations are critical for modeling complex speech patterns.

*   **Categorical Differences**: Bar plots highlighted clear distinctions in average characteristics across `phoneme_symbol` and `dialect`, and between vowels and consonants. This demonstrates how specific sounds and regional variations possess unique acoustic signatures.

*   **Concept of Latent Features and Clustering**: We simulated the creation of "latent features" through standardization, conceptually mirroring how TTS encoders transform raw features into abstract representations. K-Means clustering then allowed us to group phonemes by similar characteristics, illustrating how such techniques could categorize phonemes for targeted language learning.

*   **Modeling Phoneme Naturalness**: A simple linear regression model successfully predicted a synthetic `pronunciation_naturalness_score` from acoustic features. This demonstrated how data-driven approaches can quantify and assess speech quality, a concept central to improving TTS output and providing feedback in phoneme trainers.

*   **Interactive Exploration**: The interactive phoneme analyzer showcased the power of Streamlit to create engaging tools for language learners, allowing dynamic comparison of phoneme characteristics against overall averages. This fosters deeper phonetic awareness and supports targeted practice.

In conclusion, this exploration reinforces how a granular understanding of phoneme characteristics—duration, pitch, and energy—is foundational to both the generation of natural-sounding synthetic speech and the development of effective language learning tools. Data-driven approaches, from visualization to predictive modeling and interactive analysis, offer immense potential for advancing phonetic awareness and speech technology. The insights gained here are directly relevant to the idea of an "Interactive Phoneme Trainer," providing the analytical backbone for such an application.
