    *   Discuss how these transformed features are now ready for further machine learning tasks, such as clustering.

### 11. Clustering Phonemes by Similar Characteristics

*   **Markdown Cell:**
    *   Explain that clustering helps identify groups of phonemes that share similar characteristics, which could be useful for language learners to group similar-sounding phonemes.
    *   Relate this to the idea of understanding phonetic distinctions and similarities.
    *   Introduce the K-Means algorithm as a method to partition data into $k$ distinct clusters. Explain the objective function: "The K-Means algorithm minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), defined as:
        $$ WCSS = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in S_i} \|x - \mu_i\|^2 $$
        where $k$ is the number of clusters, $S_i$ is the $i$-th cluster, $x$ is a data point, and $\mu_i$ is the centroid of cluster $S_i$."
*   **Code Cell:**
    *   Define the function `perform_kmeans_clustering(data, n_clusters, random_state)`. This function will:
        1.  Initialize `KMeans` with `n_clusters` and `random_state`.
        2.  Fit `KMeans` to the input `data`.
        3.  Return the cluster labels (`kmeans.labels_`).
*   **Code Cell:**
    *   Execute `perform_kmeans_clustering` on `latent_features_df` with `n_clusters=4` and `random_state=42`.
    *   Add the resulting `cluster_labels` as a new column to `phoneme_df`.
    *   Create a scatter plot (e.g., `duration_ms` vs `avg_pitch_hz`) from `phoneme_df`, colored by `cluster_labels` using `seaborn.scatterplot`.
    *   Save the plot as a PNG.
*   **Markdown Cell:**
    *   Interpret the clustering results. Do the clusters visually make sense?
    *   Discuss which phonemes tend to group together based on their shared characteristics.
    *   Explain how this clustering could conceptually aid in categorizing phonemes for educational purposes (e.g., "difficult to distinguish" phoneme groups).

### 12. Introducing a Synthetic "Naturalness Score"

*   **Markdown Cell:**
    *   Reiterate the concept of `pronunciation_naturalness_score` as a synthetic metric that quantifies how "natural" or "well-formed" a phoneme's pronunciation is based on its acoustic characteristics. This is a simplified concept inspired by the "naturalness of voice" discussed in the paper.
    *   Explain that this score will serve as a target variable for a simple predictive model.
*   **Code Cell:**
    *   No function definition needed here, as the `pronunciation_naturalness_score` was generated as part of `generate_synthetic_phoneme_data`. This cell will just prepare the data for modeling.
    *   Select `X` (features: `['duration_ms', 'avg_pitch_hz', 'max_energy']`) and `y` (target: `pronunciation_naturalness_score`) from `phoneme_df`.
    *   Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` with `test_size=0.2` and `random_state=42`.
*   **Code Cell:**
    *   No direct execution, as the previous cell prepares the data.
*   **Markdown Cell:**
    *   Confirm that the features and target variable have been correctly identified and the dataset is split, ready for model training.

### 13. Modeling Phoneme Naturalness

*   **Markdown Cell:**
    *   Explain that a regression model can be used to understand how phoneme characteristics predict its perceived naturalness or clarity.
    *   Introduce `LinearRegression` as a simple, interpretable model. "Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable $y$ and one or more independent variables $X$ by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The simple linear regression equation is given by:
        $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon $$
        where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the slope, and $\epsilon$ is the error term."
    *   Mention that this simulates how a system might try to assess or even improve pronunciation.
*   **Code Cell:**
    *   Define the function `train_simple_regression_model(X_train, y_train)`. This function will:
        1.  Initialize `LinearRegression`.
        2.  Fit the model to `X_train` and `y_train`.
        3.  Return the trained model.
    *   Define the function `evaluate_regression_model(model, X_test, y_test)`. This function will:
        1.  Make predictions on `X_test`.
        2.  Calculate and print R-squared score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
*   **Code Cell:**
    *   Execute `train_simple_regression_model` using the prepared training data (`X_train`, `y_train`).
    *   Execute `evaluate_regression_model` using the trained model and test data (`X_test`, `y_test`).
*   **Markdown Cell:**
    *   Interpret the model's performance based on the R-squared and MAE scores.
    *   Discuss what the coefficients of the linear regression model might imply about the relationship between `duration_ms`, `avg_pitch_hz`, `max_energy` and `pronunciation_naturalness_score`. For example, which feature has the strongest (synthetic) influence?

### 14. Interactive Phoneme Analysis

    *   Emphasize the value of interactive tools for language learners to explore and compare phonemes, reinforcing auditory discrimination and phonetic awareness.
    *   Explain how `ipywidgets` enables dynamic user interaction within the notebook.
*   **Code Cell:**
    *   Define the function `interactive_phoneme_analyzer(df, phoneme_symbols_list)`.
    *   This function will create:
        1.  An `ipywidgets.Dropdown` for selecting a `phoneme_symbol`.
        2.  An `ipywidgets.Output` widget to display results.
        3.  A callback function that updates the output:
            *   Filters `df` for the selected phoneme.
            *   Calculates and displays the average `duration_ms`, `avg_pitch_hz`, `max_energy`, and `pronunciation_naturalness_score` for the selected phoneme.
            *   Generates a bar plot comparing these averages against the overall dataset averages for `duration_ms`, `avg_pitch_hz`, and `max_energy`, saving it as a PNG.
            *   Displays the plot and textual summary.
    *   Use `ipywidgets.interact` or `display` with `VBox` to arrange widgets and output.
*   **Code Cell:**
    *   Execute the `interactive_phoneme_analyzer` function, passing `phoneme_df` and a list of unique `phoneme_symbol` values.
*   **Markdown Cell:**
    *   Explain how to use the interactive widget.
    *   Encourage the user to select different phonemes and observe how their characteristics (duration, pitch, energy, naturalness score) change.
    *   Discuss how this interactive comparison could be a practical tool in a phoneme trainer, allowing users to understand the acoustic differences between sounds.
